Overview
========
This app allows to use ```pstorm://``` protocol to open a file in a [PhpStorm IDE](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) the same way as it's done in [TextMate, (section 21.2)](http://manual.macromates.com/en/using_textmate_from_terminal.html).

Following string must be specified as an editor in your app:
```bash
pstorm://open/?url=file://%f&line=%l
```
If something doesn't work, then feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/aik099/PhpStormProtocol/issues/new) on GitHub.
